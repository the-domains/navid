I am an assistant professor in the Aerospace Engineering Department at Cal Poly Pomona. I have received a PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from the University of California, Irvine in 2013\. My primary field of research is Astrodynamics focusing on space mission design. I am also interested in autonomous systems, navigation, computer vision, artificial intelligence, hydroclimate and statistical analysis.
After receiving my BS degree from Sharif University of Technology in Aerospace Engineering, I came to the University of California, Irvine where I have earned my MS and PhD degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. My PhD thesis was on "Efficient Methods for Phase Space Analysis in Spaceflight Mechanics: Application to Optimization of Stable Transfers" under the supervision of Dr. Benjamin Villac at UCI Flight Dynamics and Control Lab. I also wrote an MS thesis titled "Optimization of Multi-Impulse Stable Transfers". In addition to my primary research area, I have conducted research on "Global Drought Monitoring and Forecast System" at UCI Hydroclimate Research Lab under the supervision of Dr. Amir AghaKouchak. I joined Cal Poly Pomona on September 2014 as a tenure-track assistant professor in the Aerospace Engineering Department.
